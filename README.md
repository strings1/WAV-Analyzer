# WAV-Analyzer
WAV ANALYZER, developed in NI LabWindows CVI, lets users analyze and visualize signals in time and frequency domains. It supports applying filters, configurable windows, saving waveforms as JPEGs, viewing waveform-specific spectra, and displaying relevant information. It features signal tire representation and histogram viewing.


There is a .docx file (unfortunately for foreigners, in Romanian) explaining the project in detail, but here is a short overview of what you can do:

- See many infos about the analyzed wav such as MIN/MAX (and the index) from all the values, number of times it went through zero, dispersion, mean, median, skeweness and kurtosis
- Zoom in n' out on the area of data you are interested in
- Apply windows (Blackman and Blackman-Harris) and filters (FIR EquiRpl and Chebyshev I)
- Display signal Tire
- See histogram
(and probably many more stuff that I forgot since I made it ðŸ™‚)
